                Assessment
            </h1>
            <p>This page gives a brief explanation of how your translations will be assessed. This is so you will know how to prepare them and so that you will know how to assess them when you are asked to review your classmates translations.</p>
            <p>The assessment will be done under the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Poor</strong>
                    <p>The translation was inaccurate or poorly structured. This would include translations that real like they done by a machine.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Good</strong>
                    <p>The translation of the term is accurate, but the description is not very detailed or clear.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Very Good</strong>
                    <p>The translation of the term was good and the description was good too, but perhaps too long or too short. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Excellent</strong>
                    <p>The term and the description are just excellent. The description explains this concept really clearly and gives just the right amount of information. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
