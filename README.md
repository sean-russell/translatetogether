# Translate Together
This software is a peer-review based learning activity for non-native English speaking students to build their understanding of domain specific terminology. Though the tool was developed specifically for use within a CS1 class, it should be applicable in a much wider context. 

The tool is most appropriate for homegenuous group of students who all have the same native language. Though it may also be used in situations where there are large groups of students sharing a language. This would require a greater amount of administrative work. 

Translate Together is developed to support the LTI 1.3 specification as a tool provider. As such it can be used within multiple virtual learning environments. However, it has to date only been tested with Moodle.
